# js-conceptual-topics

Here I talked about all the conceptual topics of JavaScript such as js scope, hoisting, execution context, event bubble and delegation...
<br/>
Some topics are confusing in JavaScript but we need to have the clear concepts to be a good developer.
<br/>
I am trying to understanding them and these files are like rough hand notes. These will help me out in future for revising the concepts and you can also go through them...
<br/>
They may help you understanding the topics...
<br/>
The files will be kept updating over time when I will know more details about them...
<br/>
Thanks...
